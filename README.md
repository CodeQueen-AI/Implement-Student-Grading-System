# 📘 Student Grading System — README

This project is a simple Python program that calculates a student’s total marks, average, percentage, and grade based on the number of subjects they have.

## 💡 **What this program does**

* Asks for the student’s name.
* Asks how many subjects the student has.
* Uses a **for loop** to take each subject’s name and marks one by one.
* Keeps adding the marks to calculate the **total**.
* Calculates:

  * **Total Marks**
  * **Average Marks**
  * **Percentage**
* Uses **if-else** conditions to decide:

  * Pass or Fail (pass if percentage ≥ 50)
  * Grade (A+, A, B, C, D)
* Prints a complete, formatted **Student Report**.

## 🛠️ **How it works**

1. The user enters how many subjects they have.
2. A loop runs for that number and collects each subject name and marks.
3. The program adds the marks to maintain a running total.
4. After the loop:

   * Calculates average = total / number of subjects
   * Calculates percentage = (total / (subjects × 100)) × 100
5. Uses nested if-else to assign grades.
6. Displays the final results beautifully.

## 🎯 **Purpose of the Activity**

This activity helps practice:

* Taking user input
* Using **for loops**
* Using **variables** to store repeated values
* Performing **math calculations**
* Using **if-else** and **nested if**
* Printing clean, formatted output

## ✅ **Output Includes**

* Student Name
* All subject names with marks
* Total Marks
* Average
* Percentage
* Result (Pass/Fail)
* Grade
